Various musical effects based on dynamical systems

During my undergraduate years, I became interested in using (simulated) dynamical systems to create musical effects. An mp4 file is read and the waveform used as the forcing term in a suitable dynamical system. The dynamical systems I chose to explore were the Van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator and the double pendulum. The dynamical systems are modelled using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method with constant step size.
